# Feature user feedback

At **Stylight** we build features for our customers. In many cases, before rolling out the features directly to the users, we would like to get feedback as soon as possible.

## Idea
Imagine, that we are testing a feature, that allows us recommending brands. Given brand `A` the system suggesting  a `list of brand IDs` ordered by relevancy.

## System
The task of this small challenge is to build a prototype of the system, that would allow us to query API of such brand recommender system and let users rate the quality of the recommendations.

At the end of the day, our data science and product people would like to analyze the rates, that users gave for particular brand recommendations.
So we can iterate on the version and get the best users experience.


## Deliverable
- please send back a link to Github repository or a zip file with code
- provide a way how the code would be executed on our side
- all ideas how the system should be improved you can write to the readme file


## Setup
There is a simple API which you'll need, to install it simply use pip. To run the API, simply run the api.py file.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api.py
```
